/* Surprisingly everything was simple for this assignment except how to make the cards work. I managed to make the work in a cool way with stretching with 5 cards being fine and the last card stretching the width of all five cards. I thought that was interesting. I still feel weak on the actual flex (grow, shrink, basis) but I hope to find out more in the future. */
